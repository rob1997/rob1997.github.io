            "<h2>How do I plan for a pregnancy?</h2><hr />Pre-pregnancy planning keeps you — and your future baby — as healthy as possible. If you\'re thinking about getting pregnant, visit a doctor for pre-pregnancy care.<br /><h2>What do I need to do before I get pregnant?</h2><hr />There\'s lots you can do to get ready for your pregnancy and make sure you — and your future baby — are as healthy as possible. Visiting your doctor or local Planned Parenthood health center for pre-pregnancy care is a great first step.<br />Pre-pregnancy care (also called preconception care) helps find issues that could affect your pregnancy, so you and your doctor can take steps to avoid potential problems. Your nurse or doctor will talk with you about your physical and mental health, and give you any exams or screenings you might need to help make sure you have a healthy pregnancy. They can also give you tips on how to get pregnant.<br />Your doctor will talk with you about your:<br /><ul><li>medical history and family\'s medical history</li><li>current health issues</li><li>diet, vitamins, and lifestyle</li><li>safety of any medications/supplements you\'re taking</li><li>pregnancy history</li><li>safety at home and work</li><li>mental health concerns</li></ul><br /> Your doctor will probably also recommend that you go to your dentist for a checkup. If you have gum disease, getting treatment before pregnancy may prevent health problems in you and your future baby.<br />Pre-pregnancy visits are a great time to ask questions, so come prepared to ask about anything you\'re wondering about.<br /><h2>Do I need to worry about having a high-risk pregnancy?</h2> <hr /> Probably not — high-risk pregnancies are pretty rare. <br /> There are many things that can happen during your pregnancy that you can\'t control, and sometimes things go wrong for random or unknown reasons. However, there are lots of things you can do to help avoid problems and make sure you and your pregnancy stay as healthy as possible. <br /> Getting pre-pregnancy care from your nurse, doctor, or local Planned Parenthood health center before you get pregnant, and having regular prenatal care visits throughout your pregnancy are great ways to help lower your chances of having a high-risk pregnancy. <br /> Certain conditions can make pregnancy more difficult. It\'s especially important to get pre-pregnancy care if you: <br /> <ul> <li>have high blood pressure, or heart or kidney disease</li> <li>have other chronic conditions, like diabetes, lupus, or HIV/AIDS</li> <li>have a history of miscarriages, stillbirths, or premature births</li> <li>know you\'re at risk of having a child with birth defects or a genetic disorder</li> <li>have a sexually transmitted infection</li> <li>are underweight or overweight</li> <li>are older than 35</li> </ul> <br /> <h2>What\'s my partner\'s role in planning my pregnancy?</h2> <hr /> Your partner can play a big role, if you want them to. Encouragement and emotional support can be really helpful and important, especially if you\'re making changes to your lifestyle as you get ready for pregnancy. <br /> Your partner or sperm donor\'s health is also important when it comes to getting pregnant. Diet and lifestyle can lower sperm count and semen quality. This can make it harder to get pregnant. <br /> Some things that can lower sperm count include: <br /> <ul> <li>drinking alcohol</li> <li>smoking or using other kinds of tobacco</li> <li>using steroids</li> <li>using illegal drugs</li> <li>using certain prescription drugs and over-the-counter medicines</li> <li>recent and frequent time in very hot environments (i.e., hot tubs, saunas, steam rooms)</li> <li>having an unhealthy diet</li> </ul> <br /> Talk to your partner about making lifestyle choices that can help their health and your future pregnancy. <br /> <h2>Do I need a new doctor once I get pregnant?</h2> <hr /> If you already have a gynecologist, midwife, or family doctor that you like, you may be able to keep seeing them throughout your pregnancy. If you want to switch to a different nurse or doctor, friends, family members, and other nurses or doctors may have recommendations. You can also get prenatal care, or help finding a doctor in your area, from your local Planned Parenthood health center. <br /> It\'s super important that you like your doctor or midwife and feel comfortable talking honestly with them about what kind of pregnancy and birth you want to have. You may want to interview any health care provider that will be helping with your pregnancy, labor, and delivery ahead of time. And it\'s totally okay to move on to someone new if you don\'t feel comfortable. <br />",
            "<br /> Lifestyle can have a big impact on your pregnancy. Avoiding drugs and alcohol, exercising, and following a healthy diet helps you and your future baby stay healthy. <br /> <h2>What should I eat if I\'m trying to get pregnant?</h2> <hr /> Eating a variety of good foods is super important for a healthy pregnancy and baby. The nutrients you put into your body directly affect your baby\'s birth weight and health — even after they\'re born. <br /> Many people find they need to change their diet so they can have the healthiest pregnancy possible. Changing the way you eat can be hard — it may be easier to start by adding more healthy foods before you take away the unhealthy foods. <br /> Here are some tips for a balanced pre-pregnancy diet: <br /> <ul> <li> Fresh fruits and vegetables <ul> <li>Eating fruits and veggies is a good way to get lots of different vitamins and nutrients.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Carbohydrates <ul> <li>A little more than half of what you eat should be carbohydrates (carbs). Try to get most of your carbs from whole grains, like brown rice, oats, quinoa, barley, corn, and whole wheat bread.</li> <li>Limit processed and sugary carbs, like cookies, cakes, pastries, and white bread.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Protein <ul> <li>Protein helps your fetus grow. You can get protein from meat, dairy, and tofu. Nuts, beans, seeds, lentils, peas, and dark leafy greens (like spinach and broccoli) are also good sources of protein.</li> <li>If you\'re a vegetarian or a vegan, you can still have a healthy pregnancy and get plenty of protein from non-animal sources. But it\'s a good idea to tell your doctor about your diet so they can make sure you\'re getting enough protein.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Fats <ul> <li>Certain fats are healthy and help you absorb vitamins. For example, the fats in nuts, fish, and vegetables are really good for you, especially during your pregnancy.</li> <li>Limit the more unhealthy fats found in dairy, red meat, pork, fried food, and junk food. Look for foods low in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Fiber <ul> <li>You can get fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.</li> <li>It\'s good to eat at least 3–5 servings of fiber per day.</li> </ul> </li> <li> Salt, sugar, and junk food <ul> <li>Limit sugary foods and drinks (like candy, soda, and ice cream).</li> <li>Limit salty, fatty, processed snacks (like chips).</li> <li>Try to avoid processed food and fast food.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <br /> It\'s almost impossible to follow a perfect diet, and it\'s okay to indulge every once in a while. But try to eat as healthy as you can before and during your pregnancy. And don\'t forget about variety — eating many different kinds of healthy foods helps you have a balanced diet and keeps you from getting bored with your meals. <br /> Once you\'re pregnant, you\'ll need to eat about 100 – 300 more calories per day — pregnancy is hard work! <br /> <h2>What do I need to know about exercising before and during my pregnancy?</h2> <hr /> Exercise is a great way to get your body ready for a healthy pregnancy. And most people can safely exercise throughout their pregnancy. Exercising regularly during pregnancy gives you more energy and helps you feel better physically and mentally. It strengthens your body and can even help make it feel easier to give birth. <br /> Walking, swimming, yoga, dancing, biking, and other kinds of moderate exercise are popular with pregnant people. If you\'re not already exercising, talk to your doctor or midwife about the best way to start and what types of exercise are best for you. <br /> <h2>Do I need to be concerned about my weight before and during my pregnancy?</h2> <hr /> Being underweight or overweight can make it harder to get pregnant. And people who are at a healthy weight are less likely to have problems during their pregnancies. Your nurse or doctor will let you know if you need to gain or lose weight before you try to get pregnant. <br /> If your weight is usually within a normal range and you stick to healthy habits, you\'ll probably gain no more than 35 pounds by the end of your pregnancy. But each person\'s body is different, so talk to your nurse, doctor, or midwife about what a “healthy weight” means for you. They can also give you tips on managing your weight during your pregnancy. <br /> <h2>What should I avoid when I\'m trying to get pregnant?</h2> <hr /> Smoking, alcohol, and other drugs can be dangerous for your pregnancy and your future baby. Changing these habits before you get pregnant lowers your risk of problems. It\'s also important to make sure your home and work environments are safe and healthy places for you, both mentally and physically. <br /> Some habits can be really hard to change. So it\'s best to start trying as soon as you can, instead of waiting until you\'re pregnant. <br /> <h4>Smoking</h4> <hr /> Quitting smoking helps you, your future baby, and everyone around you be healthier. People who smoke take longer to get pregnant and have higher rates of miscarriage than non-smokers. <br /> Smoking during your pregnancy exposes the fetus to dangerous chemicals, and increases the chance that your baby will be born early or have a low birth weight. Smoking also increases the risk for other serious health problems after your baby is born, as well as sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). <br /> Quitting smoking is hard, but your doctor can help. And many Planned Parenthood health centers have programs to help you stop smoking. You can also call 1-800-QUIT-NOW (1-800-784-8669). <br /> Breathing secondhand smoke (smoke from other people), also has negative effects on your pregnancy. If you live with someone who smokes, ask them to smoke outside, away from you. <br /> <h4>Alcohol</h4> <hr /> Stay away from alcohol when you\'re pregnant. Most health care providers tell pregnant people not to drink at all, because there\'s no known “safe” amount you can drink at any point during your pregnancy. <br /> Drinking alcohol while you\'re pregnant can increase your chances of having a miscarriage. It can also cause you to give birth too early, and could even lead to a stillbirth. Drinking alcohol while you\'re pregnant can also cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). FAS can cause serious physical and developmental harm to your baby, like physical disabilities, learning disabilities, and other conditions. <br /> It\'s a good idea to avoid alcohol when you\'re trying to get pregnant, too. You don\'t always know that you\'re pregnant as soon as it happens, so stopping drinking before you get pregnant can help you avoid accidentally drinking during your pregnancy. <br /> <h4>Drugs</h4> <hr /> Using illegal drugs during your pregnancy can cause serious problems. These types of drugs can be really addictive. They also increase the risk of miscarriage and low birth weight. Your baby could also be born addicted to the drug. <br /> Certain legal prescription drugs can also be addictive and harm you and your baby. Tell your doctor about any medications you\'re taking, and check with your doctor before taking any new medications. They may recommend you switch to a different medication or stop altogether during your pregnancy. <br /> <h4>Chemicals and toxic substances</h4> <hr /> Toxic substances in your work and home environments can also affect your pregnancy. They include lead, mercury, fertilizer, pesticides, solvents, radiation, and cat or rodent poop. <br /> These substances can hurt your reproductive system and make it harder to get pregnant. Some can also harm your fetus if you\'re exposed to them when you\'re pregnant. Your doctor will tell you which environmental toxins to stay away from. <br /> <h4>Work dangers</h4> <hr /> Watch out for dangers in your workplace. Some jobs — like those that expose you to chemicals or are physically difficult or dangerous — may be risky before and during your pregnancy. <br /> Talk with your boss and your doctor to figure out how you can work safely during your pregnancy. And try to avoid standing for too long and working too many hours in a row. <br /> <h4>Stress</h4> <hr /> Avoiding stress and taking care of your mental well-being can help you have a healthier (and happier) pregnancy. Set time aside to do things you enjoy and that relax you. <br /> Feel free to enjoy your sexuality, too. Having sex or masturbating can help ease stress and tension, and many people have an increased sex drive during pregnancy. It\'s perfectly normal and healthy to have sex throughout your pregnancy, if you want to. (And if you don\'t, that\'s perfectly fine, too.) <br />",
            "Prenatal vitamins are made for people who are pregnant or are trying to get pregnant. Folic acid is the most important vitamin for pre-pregnancy health. <br /> <h2>What are prenatal vitamins?</h2> <hr /> Prenatal vitamins are supplements that contain daily vitamins and minerals you need before and during your pregnancy. <br /> Folic acid is the most important vitamin to take when planning a pregnancy. Folic acid is a B vitamin that cells in your body need for growing and developing. Taking 400 mcg of folic acid every day for at least 1 month before and during pregnancy can help lower the risk for problems with the baby\'s brain and spine — called neural tube defects (NTDs). Some women, like those who have had a pregnancy affected by NTDs or with sickle cell disease, may need more folic acid. Talk to your doctor or nurse about the dose that is right for you. <br /> Most nutrients should come from the foods you eat, but it\'s also a good idea to take prenatal vitamins. Your nurse, doctor, or midwife can recommend the best vitamins for you, on top of folic acid. <br /> <h2>When do I need to start taking prenatal vitamins?</h2> <hr /> Start taking folic acid at least 1 month before you start trying to get pregnant. The first few weeks of pregnancy are a really important time for fetal health and development. Taking folic acid and other prenatal vitamins can help reduce the risk of some birth defects. Keep taking prenatal vitamins throughout your entire pregnancy. <br /> <h2>Do prenatal vitamins have side effects?</h2> <hr /> A lot of people wonder about about prenatal vitamins side effects. Some people get nauseated or constipated from taking prenatal vitamins. If this happens to you, talk with your doctor about changing brands or the types of vitamins you\'re taking. <br /> Prenatal vitamins come in tablets or capsules, so finding the kind that works best with your body can help ease side effects. Your doctor or midwife can help you find a prenatal vitamin that will work best for your body."
