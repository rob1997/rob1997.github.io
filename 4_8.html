            "<h2>4 weeks pregnant - all you need to know</h2> <br> Congratulations on your exciting news! Tommy’s midwives are here to guide you through every stage of your pregnancy and help you get to know your growing baby. <br> <h4>Before week 4</h4> <br> Congratulations on your exciting news! If your periods are usually regular, conception is likely to happen in the middle of weeks one to four. You are very unlikely to know you're pregnant at this stage. <br> It may sound odd but pregnancies are measured from the first day of your last period rather than the day you actually conceived your baby. This is because it's not always easy to be sure of the exact date you became pregnant. <br> Although a fertilised egg may have implanted in your womb just two weeks ago, if the first day of your last period was four weeks ago, you are officially four weeks pregnant! This may seem odd if you think you can definitely date the pregnancy more recently. <br> <h4>What does my baby look like? - Week 4</h4> <br> The tiny person inside you is the size of a poppy seed. A little dot, measuring about 2mm. <br> The baby may be miniscule but big things are happening! The fertilised egg has snuggled into the side of your womb. It divides into layers of cells that will eventually become different parts of your baby’s body. <br> Your baby’s nervous system and heart are developing. Amazingly your tiny dot already has some of its own blood vessels and blood is starting to circulate. A string of these blood vessels connects you to your baby. This will eventually become the umbilical cord. <br> Right now, your poppy seed is known as an embryo. They get their energy and nourishment from a yolk sac (until the placenta takes over in a few weeks). Your baby is surrounded by amniotic fluid within the amniotic sac, providing a comfy cushion for them throughout your pregnancy. <br> <h4>Your symptoms - what happens in week 4</h4> <br> <b>Early symptoms of pregnancy</b> <br> <br> <b>Bleeding or spotting</b> <br> You might notice some very light bleeding, or ‘spotting’, known as implantation bleeding. This can be caused by your little seed burrowing into the lining of your womb. It often happens around the time your period would have been due and is relatively common. <br> You may also have some period-like cramping in these early weeks. <br> If you notice any bleeding at any stage of your pregnancy, though, it's important to get it checked out by your doctor or midwife. <br> <b>Sore boobs</b> <br> This week, a surge in progesterone can start to make your boobs feel tender, heavy and sore - a bit like how they might feel before your period. <br> Remarkably, these are pregnancy hormones already preparing your body to produce milk. This tenderness usually eases off by the end of the first trimester. <br> <h4>Things to do in week 4</h4> <br> <b>Smoking and alcohol in pregnancy</b> <br> It’s time to quit cigarettes and alcohol. Both can be harmful to your growing baby because the toxins pass through the placenta. <br> If you use street or recreational drugs, stop or ask your doctor for advice on stopping safely. <br> <b>STIs</b> <br> Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia, gonorrhoea, syphilis and genital herpes can affect your baby's health during pregnancy or birth. <br> If you think you or your partner might have an STI, go for a check-up as soon as you can. Your doctor or midwife can tell you where you can find your nearest sexual health clinic. <br> Don't worry, nobody will judge you and it's important to be checked as soon as possible. <br> <b>Continue (or start) taking these supplements</b> <br> There are two vitamins that are very important in pregnancy and that you can take as supplements: Folic acid and vitamin D. <br> Folic acid is naturally present in leafy vegetables, fruits and berries, beans and wholegrain products - but keep taking folic acid supplements too, until at least week 12 because you can't get enough through food alone to build up the level of folic acid that your baby needs. <br> Folic acid helps in the formation of your baby's nervous system and reduces the risk of spina bifida, which is where the baby's spine doesn't close up properly. <br> You should take: <br> <ul> <li>10 micrograms of vitamin D each day throughout your pregnancy and if you breastfeed</li> <li>400 micrograms of folic acid each day – you should take this from before you are pregnant until you are 12 weeks pregnant</li> <li>Find out more about important supplements in pregnancy.</li> </ul> <br> <b>Tell the GP you are pregnant</b> <br> Once you know you’re pregnant, make an appointment to see your doctor or a midwife to get any advice you need and to be booked in for your pregnancy care appointments. pregnancy care appointments. If you make a GP appointment, they will set you up for midwife appointments or you can call the maternity unit in the local hospital and refer yourself that way. <br> However you book it, your first appointment with the midwife will not take place until after week 8, the ‘booking’ appointment. This can make it an anxious time but reading through these dos and donts of pregnancy may help. <br> This is an important time to talk about any health issues you have to make sure your pregnancy goes well. It is very important to tell your doctor about any medication you may be on, especially long-term medicines for conditions, such as asthma, epilepsy, mental health conditions, diabetes, hormone therapy, heart problems and so on. Your doctor can make sure you are on the safest medication for you and baby. <br> <b>It is very important that you do not stop taking medication without talking to your GP or specialist</b> <br> <b>If you have an existing mental health problem</b> <br> If you have a pre-existing mental health condition and take medication, tell your doctor and the person who prescribed the medication that you’re pregnant as soon as possible. <br> They will talk to you about whether your medication is safe in pregnancy or whether you should consider a different treatment. <br> <h4>What are my chances of miscarrying?</h4> <br> It’s a sad thing to think about, but up to one in five pregnancies will end in miscarriage in the first three months. <br> If you do have light bleeding, spotting or stomach pains, this doesn't mean you are going to miscarry. However, you should always speak to your doctor or midwife and ask for advice. <br> Find out the other symptoms you should contact your midwife about.",
            "<h2>5 weeks pregnant - all you need to know</h2> <br> It’s week five and your baby’s tiny face is already starting to form - the beginnings of a tiny nose and eyes are already taking shape. <br> <h4>What does my baby look like? - Week 5</h4> <br> Your tiny baby is 9mm, about the size of a little fingernail now. <br> Your baby’s hands and feet are still just little buds. Their skull bones close around their tiny, primitive brain. <br> The outer layer of the cushiony amniotic sac develops into the placenta. Its cells grow deep into the wall of your womb, creating a rich blood supply. <br> Your placenta will give your baby nutrients (food) and oxygen through their umbilical cord. <br> It has three vessels: One thick vessel carrying oxygenated blood and nutrients to the baby (they won’t breathe through their lungs until they're born - which is why waterbirths are safe), and two thinner vessels that carry blood containing waste-products back into your circulatory system. <br> The placenta is a remarkable lifeline that also keeps bacteria and viruses away from your baby. <br> <h4>Your symptoms - what happens in week 5</h4> <br> <b>Pickles and ice cream – all about cravings</b> <br> Have you been having cravings? Or maybe you’ve taken a sudden dislike to one of your favourite foods? Cravings aren’t uncommon in pregnancy but don’t worry if you don’t get any, because that’s very normal too. Read about the 10 most-common pregnancy myths. <br> <h4>Things to do in week 5</h4> <br> <b>Choosing the best nutrition for you and your baby</b> <br> You might find it hard to believe you are truly pregnant as you are unlikely to have seen a midwife yet, but it’s time to start looking after yourself and your baby. This week we’re looking at food and nutrition in pregnancy. <br> Your body is working hard to grow a baby but it’s also very efficient, which means there’s no need to ‘eat for two’. You won’t need any extra calories until your final trimester (and at that point you will only need an extra 200 calories a day – about half a sandwich). If you have morning sickness eating small meals often to keep your blood sugar levels steady. <br> Not doubling your calories will also help you manage your weight in pregnancy. <br> Eating a healthy, balanced diet in pregnancy will give you more energy and ensure your baby gets all the nutrients it needs. <br> There are certain vital supplements in pregnancy: make sure you take a folic acid supplement to help your baby’s neural tube develop, and vitamin D. <br> <b>What foods are off limits?</b> <br> Trying to remember all the dos and don’ts in pregnancy – like which foods to avoid - feels complicated, but don't worry, and don't be too concerned if you have eaten something that is on the list, the risk is small. Talk to your midwife if you can't stop worrying about it. <br> <b>Vegetarian or vegan?</b> <br> It’s fine to follow a vegetarian or vegan diet in pregnancy but make sure it is varied and includes all the food groups. Learn more about planning your vegetarian or vegan diet to ensure your baby gets enough vitamin B12, riboflavin, iron, zinc, calcium and iodine. <br> <b>Cutting down on caffeine</b> Too much caffeine is harmful to a growing baby so it’s important to limit your intake to 200mg a day now that you’re pregnant. You might be surprised to learn that caffeine is not just found in coffee, but also in tea, chocolate and energy drinks! Decaffeinated tea and coffee, fruit juice or water are all good choices if you are used to drinking a lot of caffeinated drinks.",
            "<h2>6 weeks pregnant - all you need to know</h2> <br> By the end of this week your baby will have grown to the size of an orange pip. <br> <h4>What does my baby look like? - Week 6</h4> <br> Your baby looks more like a tadpole than a baby right now, because their back is curved and they have a tail. <br> Your baby’s heart started beating at 24 days. There’s a bulge where their heart is going to develop. Even at this very early stage, the heartbeat can sometimes be found on a vaginal ultrasound scan. <br> There’s also a bump where the brain and head are going to grow. Tiny dimples on this bump soon turn into ears and you can see a thick area where the eyes are going to form. <br> Your baby is covered with a very thin layer of translucent skin. <br> <h4>Your symptoms - what happens in week 6</h4> <br> <b>Morning sickness</b> One of the hardest things to cope with in the first trimester is morning sickness. Don’t be fooled by the name, the nausea can hit you at any time of the day. Some women get it and some don’t, some get it in one pregnancy and not the next or vice versa. Researchers have not been able to find the cause of it. <br> Even if you feel terrible, you don’t need to worry about the baby unless you can’t keep anything at all down. Your baby will get everything he needs from you. <br> <b>Morning sickness remedies</b> These are some things that women have said have helped them, though there is little research to prove that they work. There is no tried and tested morning sickness remedy other than time. <br> <ul> <li>Sparkling water</li> <li>Sucking ice cubes</li> <li>Small frequent meals</li> <li>Travel wristbands</li> <li>Foods and drinks that contain ginger (like ginger biscuits, chamomile and ginger tea, ginger ale and crystallised ginger).</li> </ul> <br> If you find you can't keep anything down, speak to a doctor or midwife. <br> <b>Pregnancy headaches?</b> <br> Some women suffer with horrible headaches in pregnancy, which can sometimes be caused by hormones or dehydration. <br> The following tips might help: <br> <ul> <li>Try to rest when you can</li> <li>Find ways to relax, like pregnancy yoga. Our 10 tips to help you relax in pregnancy is a good place to start.</li> <li>If you need painkillers, make sure you take the recommended dose.</li> <li>Paracetamol is usually safe to take in pregnancy - but not all pain relief is so if you're thinking about a different pain killer make sure to check with your pharmacist.</li> <li>Have a chat with your midwife or GP about pain relief.</li> </ul> <br> If you have a severe headache that will not go away, it’s important you’re checked out by your GP or midwife. <br> <b>Tired and emotional?</b> <br> Many women find that they get extremely tired during the first three months. Your body is working very hard so it's not surprising. <br> It can be difficult to cope with the tiredness, as you may not want to share the news of your pregnancy yet. <br> Just remember that this stage won't last forever, and the deep tiredness you're feeling usually passes when you reach the second trimester. If you can, get more sleep by going to bed earlier. <br> You may also feel emotional and tearful over little things, and you may find that your mood is suddenly going up and down because of the pregnancy hormones in your body. This is normal, but if you find that you are feeling sad more than you feel happy and the feeling does not go away speak to a midwife or doctor about it. You can read more about mental wellbeing in pregnancy here. <br> Are you suffering from anxiety and panic attacks in pregnancy? <br> <b>Smoking and pregnancy</b> <br> If you’ve just found out you’re pregnant and have been smoking, try not to worry. If you stop smoking now it will make a big difference to your and your baby’s health. We understand it’s a challenge to quit, but there’s lots of help and support out there for you. <br> Get help to stop smoking. <br> The risks from secondhand smoke are also high. You might be surprised to learn that 80% of secondhand smoke is invisible and doesn’t smell. This means that if a smoker in your household quits, the benefits to you and your baby are huge, similar to when you stop yourself. <br> If you’re worried about the amount of secondhand smoke you may be taking in, you can ask your midwife for a Carbon Monoxide (CO) test.",
            "<h2>7 weeks pregnant - all you need to know</h2> <br> Your baby, who was once the size of bean, is now the size of a grape. <br> <h4>What does my baby look like? - Week 7</h4> <br> Your baby starts to take on slightly alien-like qualities as their head grows faster than the rest of their body. This is to make room for their rapidly developing brain. <br> Cartilage starts to form in their teeny arm and leg buds. The arms grow longer and flatten out at the ends. This is the beginning of tiny hands. <br> A delicate network of nerves is spreading through your baby’s body. They are going to start making constant little motions, as their brain and spinal cord sends signals to the muscles in their body. Soon your baby will be able to feel sensations, like temperature and taste. <br> <h4>Your symptoms - what happens in week 7</h4> <br> <b>Feeling thirsty?</b> <br> The volume of blood in your body is increasing and this can make you feel thirstier than usual. Aim to drink eight medium glasses of fluid a day (sip if you are feeling sick). <br> <b>Needing to pee more than usual?</b> <br> You may notice that you need to wee more often. This often starts in early pregnancy thanks to hormones and continues as your growing womb presses on your bladder. <br> <b>Are your gums bleeding when you brush your teeth?</b> <br> The hormones make your gums inflamed. You need to take extra care of your teeth. Book an appointment with your dentist, which is free during pregnancy. <br> <h4>What to do in week 7</h4> <br> Taking steps to having a healthy lifestyle will make a huge difference to yourself and your baby. <br> <b>Staying active is safe and healthy</b> <br> Staying active while you’re pregnant is great for both you and your baby. It can help with the tiredness and has a host of other benefits. <br> The amount of exercise you can do during pregnancy will depend on how active you were before you got pregnant. <br> Even if you previously did no exercise, it’s important to start being active now for a healthy pregnancy. Being sedentary (sitting down a lot) has been shown to increase risks during pregnancy. There are lots of different things you can do to start being more active in your everyday life. Our 10 tips for staying active in pregnancy is a good place to start. <br> We also have information on the different types of exercise you can do in pregnancy and those all-important pelvic floor exercises.
