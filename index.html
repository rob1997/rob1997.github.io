            "Tables are the basic unit of data storage in an Oracle database. Data is stored in rows and columns. You define a table with a table name (such as employees) and set of columns. You give each column a column name (such as employee_id, last_name, and job_id), a datatype (such as VARCHAR2, DATE, or NUMBER), and a width. The width can be predetermined by the datatype, as in DATE. If columns are of the NUMBER datatype, define precision and scale instead of width. A row is a collection of column information corresponding to a single record. The following are two types of tables used in the PointBase RDBMS:<hr /><b>Base Table</b> - a table whose data is actually stored in the database.<br/><br /><b>Derived Table</b> - a table obtained from other tables directly or indirectly through the evaluation of a query expression. <hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br /> CREATE TABLE table_name ( column1 datatype, column2 datatype, column3 datatype, .... ); <br /><br /> The above statment creates a table with name table_name and columns column1, column2, column3, ....",
            "Indexes are optional structures associated with tables and clusters. You can create indexes on one or more columns of a table to speed SQL statement execution on that table. Just as the index in a book/document helps you locate information faster than if there were no index, an Oracle index provides a faster access path to table data. Indexes are the primary means of reducing disk I/O when properly used. You can create many indexes for a table as long as the combination of columns differs for each index. You can create more than one index using the same columns if you specify distinctly different combinations of the columns. <hr /><i>Example</i> <br /><br />CREATE INDEX employees_idx1 ON employees (last_name, job_id);<br /><br />The above statment creates index employees_idx1 on employees table for last_name, job_id consecutively.",
            "A view is a tailored presentation of the data contained in one or more tables or other views. A view takes the output of a query and treats it as a table. Therefore, a view can be thought of as a stored query or a virtual table. You can use views in most places where a table can be used. <hr /><i>Example</i> <br /><br />CREATE VIEW employees_view AS SELECT employee_id, last_name, salary, location_id FROM employees JOIN departments USING (department_id) WHERE departments.department_id = 10; <br /><br />The employees table has several columns and numerous rows of information. If you want users to see only five of these columns or only specific rows, then you can create a view of that table for other users to access.",
            "A cursor is a pointer to a private SQL area that stores information about the processing of a SELECT or data manipulation language (DML) statement (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or MERGE).<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />DECLARE<br />l_total       INTEGER := 10000;<br />CURSOR employee_id_cur<br />IS<br />SELECT employee_id<br />FROM plch_employees<br />ORDER BY salary ASC;<br />l_employee_id   employee_id_cur%ROWTYPE;<br />BEGIN<br />OPEN employee_id_cur;<br />LOOP<br />FETCH employee_id_cur INTO l_employee_id;<br />EXIT WHEN employee_id_cur%NOTFOUND;<br />assign_bonus (l_employee_id, l_total);<br />EXIT WHEN l_total <= 0;<br />END LOOP;<br />CLOSE employees_cur;<br />END;<br /><br /><br /> <b>Line</b> 4–8	The explicit cursor declaration. Move the query from the executable section (where the SELECT-INTO must reside), and use the CURSOR keyword to declare (give a name to) that query.<br /><br /><b>Line</b> 10	Declare a record based on the row of data returned by the query. In this case, there is just a single column value, so you could just as easily have declared l_employee_id as employees.employee_id%TYPE. But whenever you use an explicit cursor, it is best to declare a record by using %ROWTYPE, so that if the SELECT list of the cursor ever changes, that variable will change with it.<br /><br /><b>Line</b> 12	Open the cursor, so that rows can now be fetched from the query.<br />Note: This is a step Oracle Database performs with the SELECT-INTO statement.<br /><br /><b>Line</b> 14	Start a loop to fetch rows.<br /><br /><b>Line</b> 15	Fetch the next row for the cursor, and deposit that row’s information into the record specified in the INTO clause.<br />Note: This is a step Oracle Database performs with the SELECT-INTO statement.<br /><br /><b>Line</b> 16	If the FETCH does not find a row, exit the loop.<br /><br /><b>Line</b> 18	Call assign_bonus, which applies the bonus and also decrements the value of the l_total variable by that bonus amount.<br /><br /><b>Line</b> 19	Exit the loop if all the bonus funds have been exhausted.<br /><br /><b>Line</b> 22	Close the cursor.<br />Note: This is a step Oracle Database performs with the SELECT-INTO statement.",
            "In database management systems a record is a complete set of information. Records are composed of fields, each of which contains one item of information. A set of records constitutes a file.<hr /> <i>Example</i><br /><br /> a personnel file might contain records that have three fields: a name field, an address field, and a phone number field. In relational database management systems, records are called tuples. Records appear as rows in the database table.",
            "A package is a schema object that groups logically related PL/SQL types, variables, constants, subprograms, cursors, and exceptions. A package is compiled and stored in the database, where many applications can share its contents. A package always has a specification, which declares the public items that can be referenced from outside the package.<hr /><i>Example</i> <br /><br />CREATE PACKAGE trans_data AS  -- bodiless package<br />TYPE TimeRec IS RECORD (<br />minutes SMALLINT,<br />hours   SMALLINT);<br />TYPE TransRec IS RECORD (<br />category VARCHAR2(10),<br />account  INT,<br />amount   REAL,<br />time_of  TimeRec);<br />minimum_balance    CONSTANT REAL := 10.00;<br />number_processed   INT;<br />insufficient_funds EXCEPTION;<br />END trans_data;<br /><br />A Simple Package Specification Without a Body",
            "A procedure is a group of PL/SQL statements that you can call by name. A call specification (sometimes called call spec) declares a Java method or a third-generation language (3GL) routine so that it can be called from SQL and PL/SQL. The call spec tells Oracle Database which Java method to invoke when a call is made. It also tells the database what type conversions to make for the arguments and return value.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />CREATE PROCEDURE remove_emp (employee_id NUMBER) AS<br />tot_emps NUMBER;<br />BEGIN<br />DELETE FROM employees<br />WHERE employees.employee_id = remove_emp.employee_id;<br />tot_emps := tot_emps - 1;<br />END;<br /><br />Creating procedure Example",
            "A stored function (also called a user function or user-defined function) is a set of PL/SQL statements you can call by name. Stored functions are very similar to procedures, except that a function returns a value to the environment in which it is called. User functions can be used as part of a SQL expression.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />CREATE FUNCTION get_bal(acc_no IN NUMBER) <br />   RETURN NUMBER <br />IS acc_bal NUMBER(11,2);<br />BEGIN <br />SELECT order_total <br />INTO acc_bal <br />FROM orders <br />WHERE customer_id = acc_no; <br />RETURN(acc_bal); <br />END;<br /><br />Creating a Function Example",
            "A database object in a relational database is a data structure used to either store or reference data. The most common object that people interact with is the table. Other objects are indexes, stored procedures, sequences, views and many more.",
            "A database link is a schema object in one database that enables you to access objects on another database. The other database need not be an Oracle Database system. However, to access non-Oracle systems you must use Oracle Heterogeneous Services.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK remote <br />USING 'remote';<br /><br /> Defining a Public Database Link",
            "This database object is used to create a sequence in database.A sequence is a user created database object that can be shared by multiple users to generate unique integers. A typical usage for sequences is to create a primary key value, which must be unique for each row.The sequence is generated and incremented (or decremented) by an internal Oracle routine.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />CREATE SEQUENCE customers_seq<br />START WITH     1000<br />INCREMENT BY   1<br />NOCACHE<br />NOCYCLE;<br /><br />Creating a sequence",
            "A database trigger is special stored procedure that is run when specific actions occur within a database.  Most triggers are defined to run when changes are made to a table’s data.  Triggers can be defined to run instead of or after DML (Data Manipulation Language) actions such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER update_name_view_trigger<br />INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON emp_locations<br />BEGIN<br />UPDATE employees SET<br />first_name = substr( :NEW.name, instr( :new.name, ',' )+2),<br />last_name = substr( :NEW.name, 1, instr( :new.name, ',')-1)<br />WHERE employee_id = :OLD.employee_id;<br />END;<br /><br />Creating an INSTEAD OF Trigger",
            "Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.<br /><br />Constraints could be either on a column level or a table level. The column level constraints are applied only to one column, whereas the table level constraints are applied to the whole table.<br /><br />Following are some of the most commonly used constraints available in SQL. These constraints have already been discussed in SQL - RDBMS Concepts chapter, but it’s worth to revise them at this point.<br /><br /><b>NOT NULL Constraint</b> − Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS<br />MODIFY SALARY  DECIMAL (18, 2) NOT NULL;<br /><br />SALARY  and DECIMAL fields in CUSTOMERS TABLE can't be null.<br /><br /><b>DEFAULT Constraint</b> − Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS<br />MODIFY SALARY  DCIMAL (18, 2) DEFAULT 5000.00;<br /><br />SALARY field will be 5000.00 when value is not given and not set.<br /><br /><b>UNIQUE Constraint</b> − Ensures that all values in a column are different.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS<br />MODIFY AGE INT NOT NULL UNIQUE;<br /><br />AGE field will be a unique value/can't be the same.<br /><br /><b>PRIMARY Key</b> − Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS<br />ADD PRIMARY KEY (ID);<br /><br />Adds Primary Key ID to CUSTOMERS TABLE.<br /><br /><b>FOREIGN Key</b> − Uniquely identifies a row/record in any of the given database table.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />ALTER TABLE ORDERS <br />ADD FOREIGN KEY (Customer_ID) REFERENCES CUSTOMERS (ID);<br /><br />Specifies FOREIGN KEY to the ORDERS TABLE for CUSTOMER TABLE.<br /><br /><b>CHECK Constraint </b> − The CHECK constraint ensures that all the values in a column satisfies certain conditions.<hr /><i>Example</i><br /><br />ALTER TABLE CUSTOMERS<br />MODIFY AGE INT NOT NULL CHECK (AGE >= 18 );<br /><br />Checks if AGE field is >= 18."
